### 2. NAT Configuration
- Set up Source NAT (SNAT) and Destination NAT (DNAT) for seamless traffic flow.
- Configured port forwarding for application accessibility.

### 3. VPN Implementation
- Configured IPsec and SSL VPNs for site-to-site and client-based secure communication.
- Managed encryption settings and user authentication.

### 4. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
- Enabled IPS to identify and block malicious traffic.
- Customized profiles to suit specific threat detection requirements.

### 5. Traffic Monitoring and Analysis
- Monitored traffic using dashboards and traffic logs.
