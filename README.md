![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c121cd26-4194-4a6b-bc5b-6760ba8e4d72)
- Used scripts to manage and clear traffic, threat, and URL logs for maintenance and performance optimization.
- Conducted SYN flood tests to measure handshake performance and validate flood protection mechanisms.
- Utilized API calls and testing tools to enhance firewall log management and attack response capabilities.

### 10. Security Policy Testing

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e98913a-66d7-4ccf-9386-9614447506d9)

- Tested security policies by verifying their impact on traffic flow and connectivity.
- Used `nslookup` to confirm DNS queries were allowed or blocked based on policies.
- Conducted ping tests to validate policy behavior, ensuring intended traffic was permitted or denied.
- Analyzed policy hit counts and logs to confirm correct implementation.
